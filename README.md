Predicting the price of car using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.

**Data Preparation**

There is a variable named CarName which is comprised of two parts - the first word is the name of 'car company' and the second is the 'car model'. For example, chevrolet impala has 'chevrolet' as the car company name and 'impala' as the car model name. We need to consider only company name as the independent variable for model building.

**Proposed Data Techniques**

•	Exploratory Data Analysis
•	Regression Modelling
